## Overview

Deep learning has achieved great success in many applications such as image processing, speech recognition and Go games. However, the reason why deep learning is so powerful remains elusive. The goal of this course is to understand the successes of deep learning by studying and building the theoretical foundations of deep learning. Topics covered by this course include but are not limited to: approximation power of neural networks, optimization for deep learning, generalization error analysis of deep learning and benign-overfitting of overparamterized learning models. Instructor will give lectures the selected topics. Students will present and discuss papers on the reading list, and do a course project.

## Prerequisites
Two years of college mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, and the ability to write computer programs. CS 260 or an equivalent course.

## Academic Integrity Policy

Students are encouraged to read the [UCLA Student Conduct Code](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Individual-Student-Code) for Academic Integrity. 


## Lecture Note Scribing

Students are required to scribe one lecture note. The latex template for lecture note will be provided. The scribed lecture notes should be a zip file submitted on CCLE that compiles without errors, and it is due **4 days after the lecture**. This note will be graded. For example, if 2 students are assigned to scribe a given lecture, I expect to receive 2 separate notes. The individual notes are primarily for grading purposes (and also to make sure that each student scribes their own lecture notes), while the final version of the lecture note will be posted on the course website, after being proofread and edited by the Instructor. 

- The signup sheet for lecture note scribing can be found at [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DFReHfI875nppSevuoDSdPy3oYV9qdjVr0SLkmLQH8I/edit?usp=sharing).
- The Latex template for lecture note scribing can be downloaded at [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dfsdcpszv0hwwh4/lecture%20scribing%20template.zip?dl=0)

## Homework

There will be about 5 homework assignments. The lowest homework score will be dropped. **Homework is required to be written in Latex**. Latex homework template will be provided.
Unless otherwise indicated, you may talk to other students about the homework problems but each student must hand in their own answers. You also must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated and cite any other references and sources you use including Internet sites. 
Homework is worth full credit before the due date. It is worth zero credit after the due date. 


## Paper Presentation

After each lecture, there will be a few recommended readings. Each student is required to select one paper from the list, and prepare a 20 minutes presentation for the class. One paper can only be presented by one student. Students are expected to prepare the slides by themselves, but the original authors' slides are allowed to be used with proper citation. 

The paper presentation will start from week 5.

Both the instructor and other students will grade the presentation (no self-grading). We will provide the detailed grading criteria later.


## Project

Students are required to do a project in this class. The goal of the course project is to provide the students an opportunity to explore research directions in optimization or machine learning. Therefore, the project should be related to the course content. An expected project include but not limited to

- A novel and sound solution to an interesting problem
- Comprehensive literature review and discussion
- Thorough theoretical analysis of existing deep learning approaches

The best outcome of the project is a manuscript that is publishable in major machine learning conferences (COLT, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, UAI etc.) or journals (Journal of Machine Learning Research). **Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.**
